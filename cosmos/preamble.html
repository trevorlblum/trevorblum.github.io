<h2>How the on-line solver aid works.</h2>
In order to characterise each puzzle, there is a chart displaying on its top line <br>English letter frequency percentages, derived from a sample of medicine, astronomy and literature texts.
<br>
Below that is the count of letters actually in the current puzzle. <br>Because each puzzle is a very limited sample, of course, the English and puzzle frequencies <br>bear only a limited resemblance and present the first part of the fun of solution seeking <br>
You must ask 'is the most common letter a vowel like "E" or a consonant like "T"'?
<br><br>
Best on a PC or a large tablet, the solution proceeds by you choosing a letter from the second line <br>with a click or touch and then clicking or touching the first line number you think that letter should substitute for.
<br>
As each choice is placed on the number line, the puzzle matrix displays the result of the choices you have made. <br>If a you think a choice is clearly not helpful, click on the letter in the top line or replace it with another choice.
<br><br>
An example,<img src="images/Matrix Sample.png"></img>there are three numbers 4,23,16 as a word clue.<br>You might try B as 4, I as 23 and N as 16 to get BIN. When the matrix shows those three letters all through<br> you may feel that D-4,O-23 and G-16 makes a more likely looking answer.
<br>
The puzzle authors may, of course have decided to tease you by using ZAP. <br>Bear in mind that Z is a less common English letter, so if letter 4 has frequency of 14, Z is not a likely substitute.
<br><h3>Buttons</h3>
The red button "Clear Selections" restores the English and matrix letter frequencies and the choice lines.<br>
The "Clear matrix" red button restores the puzzle to be solved in its initial form as a grid.<br><br>
Repeat letter/number substitutions for all 26 letters and the grid will show the resolved crossword...<br>
<h3>This is what a trial substitution might look like...</h3>
<h4>First, B substituted for the number 4
<img src="images/B choice.png"></img> After a click on I then 23, followed by N then 16 you would see<br>
<img src="images/BIN substitute.png"></img>
<br>And the matrix would show (which was, by the way, not the right answer for the original puzzle)...
