        		<h3>Once, there was site named trevorblum.com.<br> It was a wild garden, overgrown with weeds and briars. <br><br>Unlike the tales, no Prince was going to come and hack through the brambles <br>to give it ( in a manner of speaking ) the kiss of life.<br><br>As always has to be part of the story, the wicked witch ICANN had cast a spell which,<br> if not broken by a Prince, would ensure the death of trevorblum.com when the site registration expired.
<br><br>
I ( not exactly Briar Rose ) had a plan to recover any goodies from the dying site<br> and create a brilliant new and dazzling site better and even more wonderful than the old.<br><br><br>

This, briefly is it. A replacement for the dying site, long live the King.
