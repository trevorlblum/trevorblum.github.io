I know, a CV is an adjunct to a job application but that's not what this is.
<br>
A bit of information about me and the purpose ( loosely speaking ) of the site <br>is all you will find here.
<br><br>
ME: Old retired and generally unpleasant, I have been there and done most of that,<br> not always willingly, but occasionally enthusiastically and generally peppered with <br>errors which it has mostly been other peoples problem to disentangle when they can<br> get me away from the disaster site.( see below )
<br><br>
The Site: I am following on from a previous attempt to provide a package of bits I deem<br> interesting if not informative. A bit of a push of my hobby-cart ahead of the <br>hobby-horse, I will probably follow a similar path to the previous, a mixture of <br>images, texts, audios and videos.
<br><br>
Why not use a friendlier platform, instagram or google or youtube? I am (refer to the <br>above ME: ) uneasy with open social platforms and unwilling to join the<br> milling , admiring throngs who post their breakfast, bigamy and bland life <br>details abroad for the purpose of accumulating the most 'likes'. With a website I<br> control, as limiting as that may be, I can resist the labradoring bid for feedback of the<br> instant gratification media.
<br><br>
Besides, a web site is cheaper over five years than the cost of a months traffic on my <br>mobile if you really want to know. As a retired software person of the 1960's <br>vintage, I enjoy the challenge of a bit of craft. A kind of macram√© hobby with a <br>mixture of language supports and media tools, I like to go 'bare metal' into HTML for <br>the site. Using GITHUB makes it easy to do updates and maintenance which, when I <br>finish writing this, will get it onto the site for the breathless world to read.
